'''
Usually refer to data structures that represent database tables or entities.

In ORMs (like SQLAlchemy, Django ORM), models define the shape of your database records â€” their fields, types, relations.

Models are tied to persistence, meaning they map to how data is stored and retrieved.

Example: A User model with fields like id, email, hashed_password, stored in a database.
