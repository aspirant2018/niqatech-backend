# Niqatech ŸÜŸÇÿßÿ∑ŸÉ: Teacher's Voice Grading App
## Vision
An application that assists teachers in recording their students' grades using a speech-to-text interface, making the grading process faster and more efficient.
## Concept
### Problem statement
Teachers spend a significant amount of time manually entering grades, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
### Proposed Solution
A speech-to-text application that allows teachers to verbally input grades, which are then transcribed and recorded automatically. This tool aims to streamline the grading process, reduce errors, and save valuable time for educators.
## Goals

- Short-term: Develop a basic prototype that can accurately transcribe spoken grades and store them in a database.The database is an Excel file .xls .
- Long-term: Enhance the app with additional features, improve accuracy, and make it widely available for educators.
